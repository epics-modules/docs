Introduction
============

This package provides EPICS drivers for the some of the USB and Ethernet
I/O modules from Measurement Computing. Currently the USB-CTR04/08 and
USB-4303 counter/timer, and multi-function modules (E-1608, USB-1208LS,
USB-1208FS, USB-1608G, USB-1608GX-2A0, USB-231, USB-2408-2A0, E-TC,
TC-32) are supported. The multi-function modules support analog input
and/or output, temperature input (USB-2408-2AO, E-TC, and TC-32),
digital input/output, pulse counters (all but TC-32), and pulse
generators (USB-1608G and USB-1608GX-2A0) These drivers are documented
separately.

-  `USB-4303 driver <measComp4303Doc.html>`__

This module is supported on both Windows and Linux, 64-bit and 32-bit.
On Windows it uses the Measurement Computing "Universal Library" (UL),
which is only available on Windows. On Linux it uses the [low-level
drivers from Warren Jasper](https://github.com/wjasper/Linux\_Drivers).
On top of these drivers the module provides a layer that emulates the
Windows UL library from Measurement Computing. The EPICS drivers thus
always use the UL API and are identical on Linux and Windows. Currently
only the E-1608, USB-CTR04/08, E-TC and E-TC32 models are supported on
Linux. Support for other modules is straightforward to add and can be
done as the demand arises.
